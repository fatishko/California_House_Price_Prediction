# California Housing Price Prediction  

This project builds a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices in California using the California Housing dataset.  

## 📂 Repository Contents  
- `notebook.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.  
- `housing.csv` → Dataset used for training and testing.  

## ⚙️ Workflow  
1. Data exploration and preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering (`rooms_per_house`, `bedrooms_ratio`, `people_per_house`)  
3. Scaling numeric features and one-hot encoding categorical features  
4. Training Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluation with MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics  

## 🚀 Future Work  
- Test advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Deploy with FastAPI or Streamlit
